#Basic Array and Object Manipulation

Write a function to calculate the total number of passengers across all routes.

Write a function that finds the route with the least number of stops and returns its name.

Write a function to create a new array containing only the stop names from all routes (flattened).

#Filtering and Searching

Write a function to find all routes that start or end at a specific stop, e.g., "A".

Write a function to filter routes that have a travel time exceeding a given limit for any stop interval.
Write a function to find and return the stop with the highest cumulative passenger count across all routes.

Sorting
Modify the sortRoutesByAverageDemand function to return routes sorted in descending order of total travel time instead of average passenger demand.

Write a function to sort the routes by the number of stops they have, in ascending order.

Reducing and Calculating

Write a function to calculate the average passenger demand across all routes.

Write a function to calculate the average travel time per stop for each route and return a new array of route names and averages.

Complex Combinations

Write a function to calculate the stop with the maximum number of passengers across all routes.

Write a function to create a summary of all routes in the format:
js
Copy code
{
    routeName: "Route 1: A â†’ D",
    stops: 4,
    totalPassengers: 440,
    averageDemand: 110,
    totalTravelTime: 26
}

Write a function that finds and returns the route where the ratio of passengers to travel time is the highest.

Custom Conditions

Write a function that removes all routes where the total passenger demand is less than a given threshold.

Write a function that adds a new property to each route indicating whether it has any stop with zero passengers.

Real-World Use Cases

Write a function to simulate adding a new stop to a route, increasing its travel time and passenger demand proportionally.

Write a function that predicts the impact of reducing each travel time interval by 10% on the total travel time.
